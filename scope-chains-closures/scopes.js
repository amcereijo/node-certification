/*
# Your Mission

In an empty file, create a function foo which contains one variable lexically
scoped named bar.

Once complete, execute @workshoppers/scope-chains-closures verify <your-file.js> to verify your
solution.

## Notes

  * [1]: There are also 4 other scopes in the language: Global, `with`, `catch`,
  *      and `eval`. These tend not to be used much, so we will ignore them.
  *
  *
  * [2]: This workshop will concentrate only on Lexical Scoping.
